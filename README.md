press '1' for singleplayer

-- intentions --
Basically, I want to create a bunch of games that are very changable and dynamic
an start programming in such a way that I allow anything to be possible. I want
to make functions with no limitations, and games with 2^32 possiblities of what
you could do. That is my intention with this pong clone, and I plan to do the
same with my future projects.
