# dynamicPong

This is the first step up a mountain.

I've been messing with programming in random things through the last six years of
my life and now I want to focus on video game development from the root. I decided
to start with the library SFML to make complete polished code for games and improve
as I made them. I've started learning APIs like OpenGL, Vulkan, and D3D12, and I
will move onto 3d games eventually, but for now I'm going to do simple things to
later push myself onto complex 3d problems, because without much footing in basic
games, who knows how well I'll do in the future.

I've decided to go on a venture to climb up the ladder of video games, in 1970s
standards I would have been considered a legend among programmers to make Pong in
a day, the first wildly commericially successful video game. I hope by recreating
simple games and gradually going through time for more complex games will give me
a grasp on better programming techniques.

ps: I sugguest using organization by type in windows explorer if you plan to modify
my little project here! It's much neater
